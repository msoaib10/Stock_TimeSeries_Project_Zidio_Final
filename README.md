# Stock_TimeSeries_Project_Zidio_Final
📈 Stock Time Series Analysis Project

🧩 Overview

This project focuses on predicting and analyzing stock prices using time series forecasting techniques. The main objective is to study stock market trends, visualize historical movements, and apply predictive models to forecast future stock prices.
By leveraging Python data analytics and machine learning libraries, the project provides deep insights into how stock prices fluctuate over time and helps understand the key factors affecting price movements.



🎯 Objectives

Analyze historical stock price data (Open, Close, High, Low, Volume).

Perform data cleaning, feature engineering, and visualization.

Build and evaluate predictive models for stock price forecasting.

Compare different algorithms for accuracy and trend prediction.

Create an interactive dashboard to visualize stock performance.


🧠 Key Features

📊 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) — uncover trends, patterns, and seasonality.

⚙ Time Series Forecasting — implemented models like ARIMA, LSTM, and Prophet.

🧮 Model Evaluation — used RMSE and MAPE for performance comparison.

💡 Data Visualization — line charts, candlestick plots, and moving averages.

📅 Forecast Visualization — predicted stock price curves for upcoming days.



🧰 Tech Stack

Programming Language: Python

Libraries Used:

pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn — for data manipulation and visualization

statsmodels — for ARIMA modeling

tensorflow / keras — for LSTM model

prophet — for Facebook Prophet forecasting

plotly — for interactive charts

🚀 Steps Involved

1. Data Collection: Collected stock price data from Yahoo Finance / Kaggle.


2. Data Preprocessing: Handled missing values, created lag features, and scaled data.


3. EDA: Explored patterns, correlations, and volatility trends.


4. Model Building:

ARIMA model for short-term forecasting

LSTM model for deep learning-based sequence prediction

Prophet model for long-term trend and seasonality forecasting



5. Model Evaluation: Compared accuracy metrics and selected the best-performing model.


6. Visualization: Displayed actual vs. predicted prices and forecast intervals.




📊 Results

The LSTM model provided the most accurate long-term prediction.

The ARIMA model captured short-term trends effectively.

The Prophet model performed best in identifying seasonality and long-term trends.




🔮 Future Enhancements

Include real-time data fetching using APIs (e.g., Yahoo Finance API).

Build a web dashboard using Streamlit or Power BI.

Add sentiment analysis from news and social media.

Deploy model as a Flask web app or Power BI integration.



🏁 Conclusion

This project demonstrates how data analytics and machine learning can be applied to financial time series forecasting. It provides practical insights into predicting stock prices, evaluating market behavior, and supporting data-driven investment decisions.
